                About 57 percent of revenues are generated in the area of coaxial cable systems and bulk cables. Cal has eight manufacturing plants in the United States and additional factories in Canada, Australia, Scotland, Brazil, China, and India; nearly half of revenues stem from products exported from the United States or manufactured abroad.

                CalTech began making and marketing microwave antennas for both civilian and military communications in 1949, and Cold War demand for Cal's products during the 1950s kept the company busy. Cal made switching devices, waveguides, and high-powered coaxial lines that were used in military radar systems. Its HELIAX continuous, semi-flexible coaxial cable came on the market in 1953 and became an important part of company growth. Coaxial cable, including HELIAX and RADIAX slotted coaxial cable, continued to make up the bulk of the company's business into the 21st century.
